## What is this all about??

Well basically, I did set out on learning how to use react hooks and the context api(thanks [Goldin](https://twitter.com/gold_olar)), and I stumbled upon [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RhOzQciVwI&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hNokByJilPg5g9m2APUePI) (fantastic one by the way), and decided to build the end project!<br />

I also got to fully Implement CRUD functionality

### Please Note

Design credit and project inspiration goes to [iamshaunjp](https://github.com/iamshaunjp)<br />

### `What I learnt`

* You should use hooks and quit using redux boy. Lol!!<br/>

* Sadly this reducer, action and dispatch concept still followed Hooks(Honestly I don tire for React!) 

### `Final words`

Clone real quick and enjoy!<br />
